_Near the Peace Statue, Brighton & Hove Seafront_

There is something calm in the foaming immensity

of waves crashing on the shore.

My phone carries my memories.

The imprinted image of fishermen against

A pearl blue sky, their black rods in silhouette

pointing towards hope, or something else:

achievement perhaps; success?

I forget.

Spinning millions of years of history

to sink without trace

I idly skimmed stones into the rushing tide,

thinking of serenity and the departed grace

of
what here was good, and what here has died.
